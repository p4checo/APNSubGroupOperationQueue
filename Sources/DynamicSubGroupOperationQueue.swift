 `DynamicSubGroupOperationQueue` is an `OperationQueue` subclass which allows scheduling operations in serial subgroups 
 inside a concurrent queue.

 The subgroups are stored as a `[AnyHashable : [Operation]]`, and each subgroup array contains all the scheduled 
 subgroup's operations which are pending and executing. Finished `Operation`s are automatically removed from the
 subgroup after completion.
