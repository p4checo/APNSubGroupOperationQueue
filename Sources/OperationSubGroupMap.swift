 `OperationSubGroupMap` is a class which contains an `OperationQueue`'s serial subgroups and synchronizes access to
 them.
 
 The subgroups are stored as a `[Key : [Operation]]`, and each subgroup array contains all the scheduled subgroup's
 operations which are pending and executing. Finished `Operation`s are automatically removed from the subgroup after
 completion.
