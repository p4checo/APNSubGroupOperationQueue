/**
 `CompletionOperation` is an `NSBlockOperation` subclass which is used internally by the `SubGroupOperationQueue` to 
 remove completed operations from the subgroup dictionary.
 
 For each operation submitted by the user to the queue, a `CompletionOperation` which depends on it is created 
 containing the logic to cleanup the subgroup dictionary. By doing this, the operation's `completionBlock` doesn't have 
 to be used, allowing the user full control over the operation, without introducing possible side-effects.
 
 These operations aren't returned by either `subscript` or `subGroupOperations` even though they technically are in the 
 subgroup.

 a concurrent queue. 
 
 The subgroups are stored as a `[Key : [NSOperation]]`, and each subgroup array contains all the scheduled subgroup's 
 operations which are pending and executing. Finished `NSOperation`s are automatically removed from the subgroup after 
 completion.
